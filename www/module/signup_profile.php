  Humans vs. Zombies at Mizzou requires all players to link their accounts with a <span class="accent_color bold">real photo and name</span> before they may join a game. This helps deter player conflicts and serves as a great identity system to recognize fellow teammates. Name and photo are only shown to other players. There are two methods.

	Method 1: Facebook
